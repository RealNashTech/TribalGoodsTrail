<h1>Content Moderation Policy</h1>

<p>We may edit, pause, or remove content or listings that violate these standards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>False, misleading, or unverified claims about Native ownership or affiliation.</li>
  <li>Harassment, discrimination, hate speech, or threats.</li>
  <li>Fraudulent offers, scams, or deceptive promotions.</li>
  <li>Content that violates laws or infringes rights.</li>
</ul>

<h2>No Verification of Business Status</h2>
<p>We do not verify Tribal enrollment, business registration, licenses, or food safety compliance. Sellers
self-identify and are responsible for truthful representation.</p>

<h2>Business Definitions &amp; Vendor Responsibility</h2>
<p>Moderation decisions consider whether the listing aligns with our standards for Native-owned
businesses and community sellers. Legal compliance remains the seller’s responsibility.</p>
