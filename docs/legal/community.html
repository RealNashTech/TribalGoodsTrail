<h1>Community Guidelines</h1>

<p>Tribal Goods Trail exists to spotlight Native-owned businesses, creators, and community sellers.
By using the platform, you agree to follow these principles:</p>

<h2>Respect and Integrity</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Engage respectfully with Native communities, cultures, and sellers.</li>
  <li>Do not impersonate Native identity or business ownership.</li>
  <li>Do not harass, discriminate, or post harmful content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quality Contributions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Share accurate information and update mistakes promptly.</li>
  <li>Keep submissions focused on Native-owned sellers and related experiences.</li>
  <li>No spam, scams, or deceptive practices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safety</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No hate speech, threats, or incitement of violence.</li>
  <li>No sharing of private information without consent.</li>
  <li>Report issues to <a href="mailto:a.gentry88@icloud.com" style="color:#79e8ff;">a.gentry88@icloud.com</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Business Definitions &amp; Vendor Responsibility</h2>
<p>Tribal Goods Trail accepts listings from Native-owned businesses, including LLCs, nonprofits, Tribal
enterprises, and independent community sellers such as salmon makers, jerky sellers, beadworkers,
firewood sellers, huckleberry gatherers, and powwow vendors. Listings may be created by sellers or
compiled from publicly available information.</p>

<p>Sellers are solely responsible for complying with Tribal, State, and Federal laws regarding business
operations, food handling, cultural representations, and product safety.</p>

<h2>No Verification of Business Status</h2>
<p>We do not verify Tribal enrollment, business licenses, food safety permits, or legal compliance. Sellers
self-identify as Native-owned and affirm their information is truthful.</p>
