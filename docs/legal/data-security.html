<h1>Data Security Practices</h1>

<p>We safeguard data used by Tribal Goods Trail through the following controls:</p>

<h2>Platform and Storage</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Data is stored in Firebase with encryption at rest and in transit (TLS).</li>
  <li>Administrative access is limited to the verified operator.</li>
  <li>Access logs are maintained through provider tooling where available.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Minimization</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We collect only the submission details necessary to list businesses.</li>
  <li>We do not store precise movement history; distance is calculated on-device when possible.</li>
  <li>No unnecessary sensitive information is collected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No sale of personal data.</li>
  <li>Limited sharing with trusted infrastructure services (e.g., Firebase).</li>
  <li>No third-party marketing trackers receive personal information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>Email security concerns to <a href="mailto:a.gentry88@icloud.com" style="color:#79e8ff;">a.gentry88@icloud.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Business Definitions &amp; Vendor Responsibility</h2>
<p>Listings include both officially registered Native-owned businesses and independent community sellers.
We do not verify licenses, permits, or regulatory compliance.</p>

<h2>No Verification of Business Status</h2>
<p>We do not verify Tribal enrollment, legal business registration, or food safety compliance.</p>
