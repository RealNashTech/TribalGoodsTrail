# Tribal Goods Trail  
A free, map-based directory highlighting Native-owned businesses, creators, and community sellers across Oregon, the Pacific Northwest, and eventually nationwide.

Tribal Goods Trail helps users discover Native-owned shops, food, art, cultural goods, services, and community-based sellers—with no account required. Listings appear on an interactive real-time map after a manual review process designed to ensure clarity, cultural respect, and adherence to platform guidelines.

## Purpose  
Native-owned businesses and cultural sellers deserve visibility—whether they operate licensed storefronts or sell directly within their communities. Tribal Goods Trail supports:

- officially registered businesses and LLCs  
- Tribal enterprises and Native-led nonprofits  
- community sellers such as salmon makers, jerky sellers, beadworkers, firewood sellers, and huckleberry gatherers  
- powwow vendors and seasonal sellers  
- independent Native artists and creators  

Listings come from a combination of seller submissions and publicly available information gathered from Tribal enterprise websites, nonprofit registries, and other free business directories.

## How Listings Work  
Sellers self-identify as Native American, Alaska Native, or Indigenous and affirm that their representation is truthful. Tribal Goods Trail does not verify Tribal enrollment or citizenship.

Platform review ensures:

- clarity of information  
- alignment with guidelines  
- cultural respect  
- truthful representation as stated by the seller  

Tribal Goods Trail does not verify:

- business licenses or registration  
- food safety or health permits  
- tax status or legal compliance  
- authenticity of cultural items under the Indian Arts & Crafts Act (IACA)  

Sellers are responsible for compliance with all Tribal, State, and Federal laws. Users are responsible for interactions and transactions with listed businesses.

- Some listings originate from publicly available information  

This legal structure ensures transparency, safety, and respect for Native communities and users.
